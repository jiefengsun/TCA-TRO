This is an implicit method.

- Example: cst_hang_weight(30), will simulate a hanging weight of 30 g. 

The implicit method sometimes will run into solving issue. 
A more reliable method is an explicit one -- just update the parameters using previous's results. 

I will update the explicit one soon.
