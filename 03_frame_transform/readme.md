This is to demonstrate the orientation of the body frame.

In the code

1. First solve a static 
2. Plot the orientation of the body frame. 


Actually, it is necessary to solve a static since only the kinematic relationship is used. 

I will add a simper code using explicit Euler method solving the kinematic relationship in next month (April).
